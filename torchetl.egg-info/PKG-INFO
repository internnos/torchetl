Description: # TorchETL
        
        If you're working on classification problem, with dataset that is available in their native format (jpg, bmp, etc) and have PyTorch in your arsenal, you'll most likely feel that the **DatasetFolder** or **ImageFolder** is not good enough. So does vanilla **torch.utils.data.Dataset**. This library attempts to bridge that gap to effectively Extract, Transform, and Load your data by extending **torch.utils.data.Dataset**.  
        
        ### Main Features
        
        Extract class would partition your dataset into train, validation, and test csv
        
        TransformAndLoad class would Transform and consume your dataset efficiently
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        Python 3.7.2 (other versions might work if type checking is supported)
        
        torch
        
        torchvision
        
        numpy
        
        pandas
        
        opencv-python
        
        sklearn
        
        
        Or simply download requirements.txt and fire 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt'
        
        ### Installing
        
        pip3 install torchetl
        
        
        ### Tutorial
